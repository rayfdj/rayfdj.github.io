## About This Site

This is my working record. It’s where I force myself to think clearly.

I write about decisions and systems that compound over time. I start from business goals, then work backward through 
incentives and behavior to understand why systems deliver the outcomes they do. Technology matters, sometimes it 
takes center stage, but it ultimately still serves human behavior and incentives. 

Some of this comes from writing code. Most of it comes from the messy reality of building teams, losing (and making!) 
money, and trying to stay healthy while doing it. Writing is the only way I know how to slow my brain down enough to 
verify if I actually understand what I'm talking about.

## About Me

I started as a builder. Over time, my work expanded into leading teams, advising companies, investing, and speaking 
publicly across different forums. I am often asked to help make sense of systems that look fine on paper but behave 
very differently in reality.

I care deeply about leverage. In organizations, capital, personal energy, and time. That lens shapes how I think 
about AI, decision-making, and longevity.

I also selectively spend time mentoring and advising people from various stages in their lives, who are navigating 
growth, responsibility, and ambiguity in their work. For the longest time in my early career, I didn't really have a 
mentor. I try to be the mentor the younger me would have appreciated.

## What You Will Find Here

Most posts will fall into a few broad categories:

- **Systems and decision-making**  
  How choices ripple through organizations, markets, and people over time.

- **Technology and AI**  
  Practical observations, experiments with the latest tools, and yes... some bikeshedding too.

- **Business and investing**  
  Notes on strategy, tradeoffs, and compounding.

- **Health and performance**  
  Treating health as a long-term system rather than a short-term optimization.

Some pieces are more polished than the others. But I wrote them with the intent to be useful.

A long time ago, back in 2006 or so, a friend asked me: "Why do you bother blogging about these things?"

Why, indeed? The question had stumped me at that time. I realized later that it was to make sure that my thoughts 
are crystal clear, and my understanding is solid. Nothing cements understanding like being able to express and explain 
something in your own voice.

## Speaking and Advisory

Many of these ideas are tested out loud before they are written down.

I speak regularly at conferences, meetups, and private forums on topics that span technology, leadership, 
decision-making, and long-term thinking. I also consult teams and companies working through 
complex issues.
